Every girl and every cycle is unique so it's important to remember that this the best estimate of your menstrual cycle. Better to feel prepared than surprised, no? </p>

                            <p>The average period lasts up to 28 days, but it’s completely normal to have a slightly longer or shorter cycle. No need to worry as it’s all very natural. Considering that, period calculator is not 100% accurate for girls who have irregular periods, as its extremely complicated to predict the date of the next period in those cases, however, it can help give you an overview of just how irregular your period is and therefore have more of an idea of what to expect in future..</p>

                              All menstrual cycles are unique, but we do have some things in common: <br>

                                <b>Pre-Period</b>
                                Premenstrual Syndrome, otherwise known as 'PMS'. Commonly you could experience symptoms of PMS such as headaches, bloating, irritability and generally feeling more emotional than normal. We all know how it feels! <br>
                                Maybe you have that 'my period is coming soon' feeling? Usually, you can experience PMS 3 days prior to having your period. Keep in mind that your diet, caffeine and stress can actually increase the intensity of PMS symptoms. <br> <br>

                                <b>Period</b>
                                Day 1 is the start of your cycle and when bleeding begins. Maybe you have wondered why do we bleed? As your egg wasn’t fertilized, your womb lining sheds and leaves your body, which explains the blood.
                                Periods generally last between 4 and 7 days, with the heaviest days being the first and second. An average cycle lasts 28 days but can range from as few as 21 days to as many as 35 days. You can predict yours with the period calculator. 
                                Keep in mind that you need to consult with your doctor if your period lasts longer then 7 consecutive days. <br><br>

                                <b>Peak Ovulation</b>
                                This is the period when you will be ovulating and be at the highest risk for pregnancy as fertile period length is about 6 days. In a 28-day cycle, ovulation typically occurs on day 14. The tracker will help you to define these days!.</p>

Day one is the first day of the menstrual period and the last day is the day before the next period begins. If your cycle lasts up to 28 days, your ovulation will be around day 14 (two weeks before your next period). This information will help you calculate your future periods.</p>
